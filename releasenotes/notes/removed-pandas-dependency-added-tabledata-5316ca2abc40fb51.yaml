features:
  - |
    Introduced a new ``TableData`` class in ``tobiko.common`` module as a
    lightweight alternative to pandas DataFrame. The TableData class provides
    tabular data manipulation capabilities specifically tailored to Tobiko's
    needs without requiring the heavy pandas dependency.
upgrade:
  - |
    The pandas library has been removed as a dependency from Tobiko. All
    code that previously used ``pandas.DataFrame`` has been migrated to use
    the new ``TableData`` class. This change reduces the installation size
    and simplifies dependency management. Users who were relying on pandas
    functionality in Tobiko should update their code to use the new
    ``TableData`` class instead. The following modules have been updated:

    * ``tobiko.podified.containers``
    * ``tobiko.rhosp.containers``
    * ``tobiko.tripleo.containers``
    * ``tobiko.tripleo.pacemaker``
    * ``tobiko.tripleo.processes``
    * ``tobiko.tripleo.services``
    * ``tobiko.openstack.topology``
    * ``tobiko.podified._topology``
    * ``tobiko.tripleo._topology``
    * ``tobiko.tripleo._overcloud``

    References to "dataframe" in function names, variables, and documentation
    have been renamed to "tabledata" to reflect this change.
deprecations:
  - |
    The pandas library is no longer used or supported by Tobiko. Any external
    code that depends on Tobiko returning pandas DataFrame objects should be
    updated to work with the new ``TableData`` class.
