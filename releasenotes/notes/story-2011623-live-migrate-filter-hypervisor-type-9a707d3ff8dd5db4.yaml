    Migration tests now filter candidate hypervisors by hypervisor type before
    selecting a migration target. This prevents test failures when attempting
    to migrate servers between incompatible hypervisor types (e.g., from QEMU
    compute nodes to Ironic baremetal nodes). Nova does not support migration
    between different hypervisor types, and tests will now properly select
    only compatible hypervisors of the same type (QEMU to QEMU, Ironic to
    Ironic, etc.) when performing live or cold migrations with an explicit
    target host.
